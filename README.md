Bouncer is an AI-powered file monitoring agent that keeps your repository clean by checking every file change for quality issues before they get in.

Think of it as a bouncer at a club - only quality gets past the door.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- `pip` and `venv`
- An [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/dashboard) for Claude

### 1. Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bouncer.git
cd bouncer

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Bouncer and its dependencies
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Configuration

Bouncer uses a `bouncer.yaml` file for configuration.

```bash
# Create a default configuration file
cp bouncer.yaml.example bouncer.yaml
```

Now, edit `bouncer.yaml`:

- Set `watch_dir` to the directory you want to monitor.
- Enable/disable bouncers and configure their behavior.
- Set up your Slack webhook URL for notifications.

Create a `.env` file for your secrets:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`.

### 3. Run Bouncer

That's it! Your bouncer is now on duty.

```bash
bouncer start
```

Bouncer will now watch the specified directory for file changes and start checking them.

---

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

For a more isolated and production-ready setup, use Docker.

1.  **Configure `docker-compose.yml`**: Mount the directory you want to watch.

    ```yaml
    volumes:
      # Mount your project directory to watch (read-only is safer)
      - /path/to/your/project:/app/watch:ro
    ```

2.  **Build and Run**:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

3.  **View Logs**:

    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f
    ```

---

## 🎛️ Configuration

All configuration is done in `bouncer.yaml`.

- **`watch_dir`**: The directory Bouncer monitors.
- **`ignore_patterns`**: A list of file/directory patterns to ignore.
- **`bouncers`**: Enable, disable, and configure each specialized bouncer.
    - `enabled`: `true` or `false`.
    - `file_types`: Which file extensions this bouncer checks.
    - `auto_fix`: `true` to allow the bouncer to fix issues automatically.
- **`notifications`**: Configure where Bouncer sends reports.
    - `slack`: Send rich notifications to a Slack channel.
    - `file_log`: Keep a detailed JSON log of all activity.

## 🧩 Extensibility

Bouncer is designed to be easily extended.

1.  **Create a new Bouncer**: Inherit from `BaseBouncer` in `bouncers/base.py`.
2.  **Add Custom Checks**: Add new functions to `checks/tools.py` using the `@tool` decorator.
3.  **Register your Bouncer**: Add it to the `main.py` factory function.
